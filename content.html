          <p class="h6 container">
            As our world becomes more digitalized throught advancements in
            technology, hacking methods and cyber attacks are advancing too.
            Business operations rely heavily on technology, as well as, customer
            service, accounting, communications and more. To avoid setting off
            any alarms, cybercriminals have become savvier at developing scams
            and attack vectors to trick victims without disrupting business
            operations.

          <p class="h4 container">- Better Information Security</p>
          <p class="h6 container">
            A critical element to any company’s cybersecurity program is having
            security controls and policies in place which are customized for
            their business. Through cybersecurity awareness training, users are
            brought up to speed on an organization’s IT security procedures,
            policies and best practices. These education modules not only help
            to ensure staff is aware of these principles but that they also
            follow and understand them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="h4 container">- Culture Of Cybersecurity</p>
          <p class="h6 container">
            Insulating sensitive business information goes beyond strong
            passwords. According to MediaPRO’s third-annual State of Privacy and
            Security Awareness Report, financial firms’ employees performed the
            worst regarding cybersecurity awareness out of the seven industries
            evaluated. Specifically, 85 percent of finance workers lacked
            knowledge around cybersecurity and data privacy. A security
            awareness program sets clear cybersecurity expectations for all
            employees and educates users about how to recognize attack vectors,
            help prevent cyber-related incidents and respond to a potential
            threat.

          <p class="h6 container">
            A data breach can dissolve any confidence that customers may have
            had in a company, or motivate clients to leave, while others pursue
            legal repercussions to impose further damage. By investing in
            innovative, comprehensive cybersecurity training to educate staff,
            customers can find ease in knowing that a partner knowledgeable of
            security risks implied in data handling is managing their data.
            Additionally, with evidence of complete training, investors can
            attain visibility into the value of cybersecurity controls.

          <p class="h6 container">
            The damages that follow a cyber-related incident can be expensive
            and detrimental for business. Thus, the benefits of investing in
            security awareness training outweigh the cost of a leak or breach.
          </p>

          <p class="h6 container">
            The following are some of the potential repercussions should your
            business fall victim to a cyber-attack:

          <p class="h4 container">- Bolster Employee Confidence And Reduce Stress</p>
          <p class="h6 container">
                According to a recent Kaspersky Lab study, 69 percent of people said they felt stressed by data breach news. Keeping employees abreast of the latest threat intelligence and attack methods will help mitigate the anxiety caused by cybersecurity uncertainty. In addition to reducing stress, security training will help eliminate risky behavior and instill security best practices company-wide.

By accentuating cybersecurity as a priority for your company, employees are provided with the advanced tools and resources needed for adequate training. Furthermore, it enables shared responsibility among staff for safe technology usage.
